to run server)

after you clone the code, in the server directory run the following command to install the dependencies:
npm install
then after a successfull dependency insstallation you may run the following command to run the server:
npm start

its worth mentioning that currently the server is serving at port 2000, so you can check it out at:
localhost:2000
an example for an api at the moment is:
http://localhost:2000/tasks
which you need to utilize it using http get verb, in this case your browser may be helpful.



to run client)

after you clone the code, in the client directory run the following command to install the dependencies:
npm install
then after a successfull dependency insstallation you may run the following command to run the client:
npm run dev

its worth mentioning that currently the client code is serving at port 8080 so you can check it out at:
localhost:8080



**always remember, you are not doing any rocket science at this project, take it easy and think before coding.


have fun!
